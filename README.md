# Social-Space-Validator
The system “Social Spacing Validator” pacts with the application to conclude the distance between two individuals and validate the distance.
Social distancing is crucial for preventing the spread of disease. Using computer vision technology
built on Open CV and YOLO-based deep learning, we are able to estimate the social distance in video
streams. Then this app will compare the distance with the safe distance prescribed by the
doctors. The Convolutional Neural Network method & computer vision methods are
employed in this work. Initially, an open-source object detection project based on the
YOLO algorithm was used to identify the pedestrian in the video frame.
